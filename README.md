# 🧙‍♂️ Telegram RPG Bot

*A pure PHP text-based RPG adventure — played entirely in Telegram chat!*

## 🎮 What is this?

This is a **fully text-based RPG game** that runs entirely within Telegram, using the **Telegram Bot API**.
Built with 💯% pure **vanilla PHP** — no frameworks, no libraries — just raw PHP code, the way nature intended.
Database interactions are handled with **PDO** and classic **SQL queries** for all CRUD operations.

I built this game when I was still learning to code — **self-taught PHP**, no formal education, no fancy tools... just coffee, chaos, and `var_dump()`s. ☕😅
Despite that, over **100 players** joined and played it — and hey, **it worked**... mostly.
So if you see spaghetti in the code, just know: it's **functional spaghetti**. 🍝🧠

## ⚠️ A Little Disclaimer...

I built this game while I was still figuring out what `OOP` even meant.
It's not the cleanest code, and definitely not the most efficient...
But it was my **first big project**, and it worked! 🎉
**Over 100 players** used it, battled monsters, and leveled up — so hey, if it’s dumb but works... it’s not that dumb. 😎
